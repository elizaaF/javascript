    <div class="content-container">
    <div class="question">
      1. What is the Sun primarily made of?</div>
      <div class="answer">
        The Sun is mainly composed of hydrogen, which makes up about 75% of its mass. The next most abundant element is helium, comprising about 24%. These two elements undergo nuclear fusion in the Sun's core, producing energy that powers the Sun and emits light and heat. In addition to hydrogen and helium, trace amounts of heavier elements like oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and others are also present, though they account for less than 2% of the Sun's composition.</div>
    <div class="question">
    2. How long does it take for sunlight to reach Earth?</div>
      <div class="answer">
        Sunlight travels across the vacuum of space at the speed of light, which is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second. Despite this incredible speed, it still takes around 8 minutes and 20 seconds for the light to cover the distance of about 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) between the Sun and Earth. This means that when we see sunlight, it actually left the Sun about 8 minutes earlier.</div>
    <div class="question">
      3. Which planet in the Solar System is the largest?</div>
      <div class="answer">
        Jupiter is the largest planet in our Solar System, with a diameter of around 142,984 kilometers (88,846 miles). This gas giant is so massive that it could fit more than 1,300 Earths inside it. Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, similar to the Sun, and it has at least 79 known moons, with Ganymede being the largest, even bigger than the planet Mercury.</div>
    <div class="question">
      4. What is the main reason for the seasons on Earth?</div>
      <div class="answer">
        The seasons on Earth occur due to the planet's axial tilt of about 23.5 degrees. As the Earth orbits the Sun, different parts of the Earth receive varying amounts of sunlight at different times of the year. When the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun, it experiences summer, while the Southern Hemisphere, tilted away from the Sun, experiences winter, and vice versa. This axial tilt, rather than the distance from the Sun, is the primary cause of seasonal changes.</div>
    <div class="question">
      5. What is the asteroid belt, and where is it located?</div>
      <div class="answer">
        The asteroid belt is a vast region of space situated between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. It contains a large number of rocky objects, ranging in size from dust particles to dwarf planets like Ceres. The asteroid belt formed during the early stages of the Solar System's development from leftover material that never coalesced into a full-sized planet, likely due to the gravitational influence of Jupiter. Although there are many asteroids, the belt is mostly empty space, and the objects are spread out over vast distances.</div>
